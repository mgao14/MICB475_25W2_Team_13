# February 5th, 2026 Team Meeting
### Agenda
1. Discuss potential project topics:

   Typhoid Vaccine:
   - Are there any specific taxa enriched or depleted in responders vs non-responders?
   - Is gut microbiome diversity after single-dose typhoid vaccination associated with participant age?

   Infant Feeding:
   - How does vaginal vs. C-section delivery shape infant gut microbiome diversity and community composition across [certain age]?
   - Can microbiome profiles be used to predict age?
   - Do infants with higher WLZ (weight-for-length Z score) or WAZ (weight-for-age Z score) show accelerated microbiome maturation/greater microbiome diversity? Can also look into other categories related to growth.
   - Is infant gut microbiome composition associated with appetite scores?

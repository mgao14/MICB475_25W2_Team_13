# February 5th, 2026 Team Meeting
### Agenda
1. Discuss potential project topics:

   Typhoid Vaccine:
   - Are there any specific taxa enriched or depleted in responders vs non-responders?
   - Is gut microbiome diversity after single-dose typhoid vaccination associated with participant age?
   - Longitudinal microbiome changes across DPI (independent of responder status)?
   - Whether the dose of vaccine affects the microbiome structure of recipients independent of the antibody response category?
   - Do IgA-only and IgG-only responders have distinct microbiomes? (differences in mucosal and humoural immunity)

   Infant Feeding:
   - How does vaginal vs. C-section delivery shape infant gut microbiome diversity and community composition across [certain age]?
   - Can microbiome profiles be used to predict age?
   - Do infants with higher WLZ (weight-for-length Z score) or WAZ (weight-for-age Z score) show accelerated microbiome maturation/greater microbiome diversity? Can also look into other categories related to growth.
   - Is infant gut microbiome composition associated with appetite scores?

   Anemia during Infancy:
   - Does taking different types of iron supplementation lead to difference in gut microbiome compositions of anemic infants?

   Alcohol Consumption:
   - Are the oral microbiome community composition variations caused by alcohol consumption associated to specific alcohol-related diseases? Possibly cross reference with smoking.
